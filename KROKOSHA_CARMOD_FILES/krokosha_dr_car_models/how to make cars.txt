notes to not forget how to make car:



example directory:
- my_new_car/
- - carconfig.txt
- - my_new_car.obj
- - my_new_car.png
- - my_new_car.ogg (optional, its engine sound)
- - wheel.obj (optional, its wheel model)

directory and model and texture have to have same name!
only config, model and texture are required, otherwise the car will not render
everything else will be ignored.
engine sound is optional


only supports:
".obj" as 3d model  (blender export parameters at the end of file)
".png" as texture
".ogg" as engine sound


TROUBLESHOOTING? 
- if anything is wrong and model or texture load failed (it requires both), it will fallback to rendering just a rectangle without telling 


Car config txt:
comments defined with //
everything else can by figured out from already existing configs
note: car usually doesnt reach maxspeed by around 20 speed units
all units are based on gamemaker pixels with no real world reference, so it requires manual tinkering

if a config entry is not specified, default value is used
Also some of these values are too small for deltarune, consider defining them all.

// main handling 1
wheelbase_x = 3.5 // number , in GameMaker pixels,  3.5 is extremely small
wheelbase_y = 9 // number
layout = 2 // int powertrain layout: fwd = 1, rwd = 2, awd = 3
// main handling 2
maxspeed = 225 // number
reversemaxspeed = 27 // number
acceleration = 5 // number
brakestrength = 5 // number
steerspeed = 20 
tiretraction = 0.5
// physics
vehiclemass = 1.0 // affects car to car collsision response, heavier car and plow easier through light car
// visuals
electricengine = false // true/false 
wheelscale = 1.0 // number
maxleanangle = 12 // number (degrees)
leanmultiplier = 1.4 
renderwheels = false // true/false 
wheelrimcolor1 = FF0000 // hex color, only when using default wheels
wheelrimcolor2 = 0000FF // hex color, only when using default wheels
renderfidelity = 1.0 // multiply the resolution, min 0.5, max 8.0  (aka 64px to 1024px  ( default 1.0 = 128px ))






CAR CREATION CHECKLIST:
txt
obj
png
3d model bottom center of wheelbase is at 0,0,0
length units are in PIXELS  (compare to original deltarune car sprites resolution for reference)
max size 90 units on all axis (or the render will be cropped)

and the black outline is rendered automatically - it just renders 1 more pixel around the car


default wheels: 
Wheels are 8 pixel radius  cylinders (16 pixels diameter) and 5.3 pixels wide
wheels texture is only shader-based from two colors provided by wheel_color entries in car config
wheels are placed at the ends of wheelbase (and in 3d vertical axis 0)



BLENDER OBJ EXPORT PARAMETERS:
Selection Only = On
Forward Axis = -Y
Up Axis = +Z
UV Coords = On
Normals = Off
Colors = Off
Triangulate = On
Apply Modifiers = On
-everything else default
