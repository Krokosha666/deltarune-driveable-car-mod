Title: 
Delta Theft Auto (sorry, might be misleading)


Description:

MOST USELESS MOD EVER!
This mod grants you the ability to drive most cars seen in the game with true car-like physics.
No, this mod doesn't make literal GTA out of Deltarune, it only allows driving cars.

 = Features:
3D car models ... in a 2d game, yeah... 
Your party members will enter the car with you.
Your party members will comment on your driving. (but not in CH1)
Actual tire skid marks.
Car spawn menu + despawn button.
All cars have unique parameters, like acceleration or handling.
Running over (some) enemies in dark world. ( no consequences )
Easy way to add your own car models. (more info in the README)

 = Warnings:
You may break or skip scripted sequences while driving.
You can't enter cars while in a cutscene. (Sometimes cutscene allows you to move, just so you know.)
You can't use cars in battle. (duh)
It is hard to drive in tight spaces, you'll want to noclip sometimes. (The game is not made for cars.)
If you want to complete entire game while driving, you will have to respawn cars and noclip alot.
This mod is made for the Steam Paid version of Deltarune.

 = Car list:
Toriel Van 
Asgore Truck 
Queen Cyber Car 
Egg Man's Car (the one that Undyne uses for bench presses)

I actually made this mod back in June after the Asgore memes started popping up. 
Then i paused cuz didn't feel like creating more models and testing the entire game.
I had trouble picking a name for this mod so i just went with GTA. 
I do not want to mention asgore driving his truck.

Known issues and bugs:
You can skip and break out of scripted sequences and cutscenes, that may result in a game crash.
 - Sometimes the car will explode to avoid this.
Collision physics are simple and sometimes you can end up out of bounds or stuck. 
 - Just avoid ramming stuff while drifting. To recover hold "T" for noclip.
Car to Car collision physics are terrible and glitchy.  
 - Avoid ramming other cars.
Rarely Kris can get stuck in a wall when exiting a car. (in dark world)
 - Don't park too close to walls.
Sometimes empty cars disappear when re-entering the room. (or not? i forgor)

I didn't test the entire game properly, playthrough takes too long.
Honestly, the code is so bad that i thought i would never release this.
And im kinda tired after working on this, don't expect updates, maybe only when more chapters release.
